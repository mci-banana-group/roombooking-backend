## Authentication

(Authentication Readme generated by AI)
All protected endpoints require a JWT Bearer token.

### 1. Obtain a Token

Send a `POST` request to `/auth/login` with your credentials:

```json
{
  "email": "admin@mci.edu",
  "password": "password"
}
```

You will receive a response containing the token:

```json
{
  "token": "your_jwt_token_here",
  "user": {
    "firstName": "Admin",
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Use the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests to protected endpoints:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here
```

### Example (JavaScript/Fetch)

```javascript
const token = "your_jwt_token_here";

fetch('https://roombooking-backend-l7kv.onrender.com/rooms', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
